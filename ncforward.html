<h4>Long version</h4>
NCforward is a small project i started to implement a feature in iOS Apple should have implemented way earlier.
The feature is to forward every single notification you get on your loved iDevice to any other computer in your local network.
No matter what OS, no matter how these are displayed, just forward them, anywhere. Currently i only wrote a Windows client but making one for Mac/Linux/...
is not hard at all if you know a bit about scripting and networking! Look down for more info!
You can download the Tweak, which you WILL have to install, right here on my repo: <a href="http://BannerBomb.github.io/repo/" target="blank_">BannerBomb' Cydia repo</a>.
You can install the Windows "client" counterpart by clicking on <a href="Files/NCForward1.exe" target="blank_">THIS LINK</a>, downloading the file and
putting it into your Autostart folder (Which is somwhere here: C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup).
If you don't want to reboot, just execute it now by double-clicking and say yes if Windows asks you to allow network access.<br><br>
As always, you do this ON YOUR OWN RISK!
<h4>Protocol documentation</h4>
As promised, it is very simple to write a notification reciever for the NCForward1 protocol. The whole thing is based on the UDP/Datagram protocol which
allows you to have connectionless communication between two devices, so communication is as easy as i could do it. The whole thing is, the iDevice sends
a packet (message) to a computer which is in the same network and which has a client (well, the computer is the SERVER and the iDevice is the client but
anyways :P) running which recieves the messages and displays them on the PC. No packets are sent back as confirmation, no connection is established, just
the very basics. This also means that EVERY single computer is able to recieve your notifications as long as you set a different reciever address in your
settings, the default is to broadcast to the whole local network on 255.255.255.255 but you can set this to any IP in your (W)LAN.<br><br>
The packages are sent to the port 3156 on the reciever's computer and consist of 8 parts, each of them will is separated by the characters <i>%!</i>.
This is no good practice, i know but easy to do :P.<br><br>
The eight parts are:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>1</td><td>NCFV1_PV1</td><td>The protocol identifier, NCF: magic, V1: version 1, _P: magic, V1: protocol version 1. You should really check these as they
may change soon in a later revision!</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>bulletin.sectionDisplayName</td><td>The bulletin section display name?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>bulletin.topic</td><td>The topic?</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>bulletin.sectionID</td><td>The section ID?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>bulletin.content.title</td><td>The title of the notification you can see on your iDevice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>bulletin.content.subtitle</td><td>A subtitle?</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>bulletin.content.message</td><td>The message of the bulletin you can see on your iDevice.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>bulletin.date.description</td><td>Some date.</td></tr>
</table>
As you may recognized, only numbers 1, 5 and 7 are currently used by my Windows client, i don't really know what the others are.
If you came up with something awesome, tell me (<a href="mailto:BannerBomb55@gmail.com?subject=BannerBombs website - NCForward">BannerBomb55@gmail.com</a>)
and i will (maybe) link it here!<br><br>
This piece of software is completely open-source, look at <a href="http://github.com/BannerBomb/ncforward/" target="blank_">the Github repo here!</a><br><br>
